# CLI-REPO-TOOL

CLI-REPO-TOOL is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of creating GitHub repositories. With RepoGenie, you can quickly generate a new repository, complete with a `.gitignore` file and the essential `.git` folder, all in just a few simple steps.

**Tech Used**

CLI-REPO-TOOL is built using **Node.js**.

## Features

- **Automated Repository Creation**: RepoGenie automates the creation of GitHub repositories, saving you time and effort.
- **Personal Token Authentication**: Utilize your GitHub personal access token for seamless authentication and repository creation.
- **Customizable `.gitignore`**: Choose from a variety of predefined `.gitignore` templates or create your own to tailor your repository setup.
- **Efficient Workflow**: With RepoGenie, you can focus on your code rather than setting up repositories manually.

## Optimizations

This project is not completed. I'm still trying to work around authentication issues based on the Octokit Auth-Basic now deprecated. It works if you create a personal access token and include it in the `.env` file. But my plan is to have users input the token on the command line. Just like they would with the Auth-Basic username and password. So all the activity is on the command line. No need to mess with the code.
I also need to make it available for global integration so users can use:

```javascript
CLI-REPO-TOOL <repo-name> <longer repo description>
```
